# NeMo Retriever Library Overview { #what-is-nemo-retriever-library }

NVIDIA NeMo Retriever Library (NRL) extracts text, tables, charts, infographics, and transcripts from PDFs, HTML, Office documents, audio, video, and images. Run it as a Python library or Kubernetes deployment, and route inference through NVIDIA NIM microservices or local Nemotron models for downstream RAG and generative applications.

NeMo Retriever Library splits documents into pages, classifies sub-page content (text, tables, charts, and infographics), extracts it, and applies optical character recognition (OCR) where needed into a standard schema. It can compute embeddings for extracted content and store vectors in [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) when you pass `vdb_op="lancedb"` to upload (refer to [Vector databases](vdbs.md)).

## NVIDIA AI Enterprise (NVAIE) support { #nvidia-ai-enterprise-nvaie-support }

!!! warning "The NeMo Retriever Library is not supported under NVIDIA AI Enterprise (NVAIE)"

    NVIDIA AI Enterprise (NVAIE) support does **not** cover the NeMo Retriever Library. This applies to the NeMo Retriever Library Python package, its container image, and its Helm chart artifacts.

    Some individual NIM microservices and models that the library calls—for example, the default NIMs in the [Pre-Requisites & Support Matrix](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#default-helm-nims)—may be covered by NVAIE on their own. That coverage applies only to those individual NIMs and models. It does **not** extend to the NeMo Retriever Library or its end-to-end extraction workflow. Using NVAIE-supported NIMs or models through the NeMo Retriever Library does not make the library, its container, or its chart NVAIE-supported.

## What NeMo Retriever Library Is ✔️ { #what-nemo-retriever-library-is }

The following diagram shows the retriever pipeline.

![Overview diagram](images/overview-extraction.png)

NeMo Retriever Library does the following:

- Accept directories of input files and configurable ingestion tasks
- Store extracted content in a vector database (VDB) with discrete metadata elements
- Support multiple extraction methods per document type—for example, PDFs can use **pdfium** or [Nemotron Parse](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-parse) as an alternate method (`method="nemotron_parse"`)
- Apply pre- and post-processing: text splitting and chunking, transforms and filtering, embedding generation, and image offloading to storage

!!! note
    To use `method="nemotron_parse"` with PDFs, install the Nemotron Parse client dependencies with the `nemotron-parse` extra, for example `uv pip install "nemo-retriever[nemotron-parse]"`. You can use the equivalent `pip install` command if you do not use UV.

NeMo Retriever Library supports the following file types:

- `avi`
- `bmp`

- `mp3`
- `mp4` 
- `pdf`
- `png`
- `pptx`
- `sh` (treated as text)
- `svg` (NeMo Retriever Library only, requires `cairosvg`)
- `tiff`
