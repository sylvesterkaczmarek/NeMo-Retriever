# Agentic retrieval (concept)

**Agentic retrieval** is iterative, tool-driven retrieval. A large language model (LLM) agent plans steps, issues search tool calls, fuses candidates, and ranks documents until it has enough context. **One-pass retrieval** sends a single static query through dense or hybrid search and returns chunk-level hits.

NeMo Retriever Library includes a first-class agentic query path. `retriever query --agentic`, `POST /v1/query` with `agentic=true`, and the `agentic_query` Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool run a Reason and Act (ReAct) loop over the same LanceDB table that one-pass retrieval uses. You do not have to implement the agent loop in application code.

The agentic path ranks documents rather than chunks. CLI `--agentic` output is the retrieval-hop hit plus `doc_id`, `rank`, and `result_source`. It is not the five-field dense CLI projection. Local CLI and harness runs default to an in-process vLLM agent LLM. Retriever Service requires a remote OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. A self-hosted vLLM-backed NIM must enable automatic tool choice and a tool-call parser. Helm `answer_llm` does not turn those options on by default.
