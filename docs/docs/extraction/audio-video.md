## Speech and audio extraction { #speech-and-audio-extraction }

This documentation describes two ways to run [NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md) with the [parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us ASR NIM microservice](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/asr/deploy-asr-models/parakeet-ctc-en-us.html) (`nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us`) to extract speech from audio files:

- Run the NIM locally on your cluster with the [NeMo Retriever Helm chart](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md)
- Use NVIDIA Cloud Functions (NVCF) endpoints for cloud-based inference

Supported file types for speech extraction today:

- `mp3`, `wav`
- `mp4`, `mov`, `mkv`, `avi` — common video containers; the audio track is transcribed (same extensions as in [NeMo Retriever Library Overview](overview.md))

[NeMo Retriever Library](overview.md) supports extracting speech from audio for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Similar to how the multimodal document pipeline uses detection and OCR microservices, NeMo Retriever Library uses the [parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us ASR NIM](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/speech/latest/asr/deploy-asr-models/parakeet-ctc-en-us.html) to transcribe speech to text, then embeddings through the NeMo Retriever embedding path.

Before running audio extraction from Python with either self-hosted or hosted Parakeet, install the multimedia extra so the Parakeet ASR client can decode and resample audio:

```bash
pip install "nemo-retriever[multimedia]"
# For local GPU inference, include both extras:
pip install "nemo-retriever[local,multimedia]"
```

The Python package includes the `ffmpeg-python` wrapper, and the multimedia
extra adds Python libraries for audio decoding and resampling. These Python
dependencies do not install the `ffmpeg` or `ffprobe` command-line binaries.
For audio and video workflows, install system FFmpeg so both binaries are on
`PATH`:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ffmpeg
```

Containers use the FFmpeg package from the base Ubuntu image, rather than a
source-built FFmpeg release. If your workflow depends on exact FFmpeg version
or codec behavior, verify the package inside the image against those
requirements.

For Kubernetes deployments with network access to package repositories, set
`service.installFfmpeg=true` in the
[Helm chart](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#1-service-image)
to install ffmpeg/ffprobe at service startup. This runtime path requires
package-repository network egress, a writable root filesystem, and a security
policy that allows the image's scoped sudo use. For air-gapped clusters, refer to
[Air-gapped and disconnected deployment](deployment-options.md#air-gapped-deployment).

!!! important

    Due to limitations in available VRAM controls in the current release, the parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us ASR NIM must run on a [dedicated additional GPU](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#model-hardware-requirements). For the full list of requirements, refer to the [Pre-Requisites & Support Matrix](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#model-hardware-requirements).

This pipeline enables retrieval at the speech segment level when you enable segmenting (refer to the examples below).

## Run Parakeet on the cluster (Helm) { #run-parakeet-on-the-cluster-helm }

Use the following procedure to run the NIM on your own infrastructure. Self-hosted Parakeet runs on Kubernetes through the [NeMo Retriever Helm chart](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md). Parakeet is disabled by default and is not auto-wired into the retriever service. Refer to [Optional Helm NIMs](prerequisites-support-matrix.md#optional-helm-nims-not-auto-wired-by-default) for the enablement table. GPU pinning is documented in [Parakeet ASR](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#audio-video-parakeet).

1. Deploy or upgrade with the [NeMo Retriever Helm chart](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md). Set both of the following values, then follow [Deployment options](deployment-options.md).

    ```yaml
    nimOperator:
      audio:
        enabled: true

    serviceConfig:
      nimEndpoints:
        audioGrpcEndpoint: audio:50051
    ```

    Equivalent Helm flags are `--set nimOperator.audio.enabled=true` and `--set serviceConfig.nimEndpoints.audioGrpcEndpoint=audio:50051`.

    Enabling only the audio NIM deploys Parakeet and leaves `audio_grpc_endpoint` set to `null`.

2. If the service will process audio or video files, set `service.installFfmpeg=true` in the Helm chart when your cluster allows runtime package installation; for air-gapped clusters, refer to [Air-gapped and disconnected deployment](deployment-options.md#air-gapped-deployment) and the [Helm chart README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Retriever/blob/26.08.1/nemo_retriever/helm/README.md#1-service-image) for `service.image` overrides.

3. After the services are running, interact with the pipeline from Python (refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md) for parameter details).

    - In `batch` mode, pass the in-cluster Parakeet gRPC endpoint through `ASRParams.audio_endpoints`. Use `audio:50051` from your Helm release. Graph ingest does not read the Helm service endpoint.

    ```python
    from nemo_retriever import create_ingestor
    from nemo_retriever.common.params.models import ASRParams

    ingestor = (
        create_ingestor(run_mode="batch")
        .files("./data/*.wav")
        .extract_audio(
            asr_params=ASRParams(
                audio_endpoints=("audio:50051", None),  # (grpc_endpoint, http_endpoint)
                segment_audio=True,
            ),
        )
    )
    results = ingestor.ingest()
    ```

    To generate one extracted element for each sentence-like ASR segment, pass `asr_params=ASRParams(segment_audio=True)` to `.extract_audio(...)`. This option applies when audio extraction runs with a self-hosted Parakeet NIM or using build.nvidia.com hosted inference, but has no effect when using the local Hugging Face Parakeet model.

    For more runnable examples, refer to [Workflow: Ingest documents](workflow-document-ingestion.md).

## Parakeet with hosted inference (build.nvidia.com) { #parakeet-hosted-inference-build-nvidia }

Instead of running the pipeline locally, you can call Parakeet through [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/) hosted inference.

1. On the Parakeet model page on [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/), create or copy an API key and note the function ID for hosted access. You need both before making API calls.

2. Run inference from Python with the hosted gRPC endpoint and credentials from that page (the example below uses the default hosted gRPC hostname; confirm values in the **Get API Key** flow for your deployment). Pass hosted endpoint, function ID, and API key through `ASRParams` (`audio_endpoints`, `function_id`, `auth_token`).

    For parameter details, refer to the [Python API guide](nemo-retriever-api-reference.md).

    ```python
    from nemo_retriever import create_ingestor
    from nemo_retriever.common.params.models import ASRParams

    ingestor = (
        create_ingestor(run_mode="batch")
        .files("./data/*.mp3")
        .extract_audio(
            asr_params=ASRParams(
                audio_endpoints=("grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com:443", None),  # (grpc_endpoint, http_endpoint)
                function_id="<function ID>",
                auth_token="<API key>",
                segment_audio=True,
            ),
        )
    )
    results = ingestor.ingest()
    ```

    !!! tip

        For more runnable examples, refer to [Workflow: Ingest documents](workflow-document-ingestion.md).

## Video and frame OCR { #video-and-frame-ocr }

For video assets, NeMo Retriever Library can combine audio or speech processing (refer to [Speech and audio extraction](#speech-and-audio-extraction) above) with visual text extraction when OCR applies to frames or derived images.

For OCR-oriented extract methods on scanned or image-heavy content, refer to [OCR and scanned documents](multimodal-extraction.md#ocr-and-scanned-documents), [text and layout extraction](multimodal-extraction.md#text-and-layout-extraction), and [Nemotron Parse](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-parse) for advanced visual parsing.

Container formats and early-access video types are listed under [supported file types and formats](multimodal-extraction.md#supported-file-types-and-formats) (refer to [NeMo Retriever Library Overview](overview.md) for the full list).

For end-to-end RAG stacks that include multimodal ingestion, refer to the [NVIDIA AI Blueprints catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover) and related solution pages on [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/).
