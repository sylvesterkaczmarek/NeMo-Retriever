"""Abstract Vector Database (VDB) operator API.

Defines the `VDB` abstract base class — the small interface that custom
vector-database operators implement to plug into NeMo Retriever.

The interface separates ingestion from retrieval so the same ABC works for
both halves of the pipeline:

- `create_index` / `write_to_index` / `run` — index lifecycle and bulk
  ingestion of Nemo Retriever Library (NRL) record batches.
- `retrieval` — nearest-neighbor search over **precomputed query vectors**.
  Query strings are embedded upstream (see `nemo_retriever.Retriever`);
  the VDB search boundary receives vectors as the primary input. Backends
  that combine dense and lexical evidence may also receive aligned
  `query_texts` as execution-only retrieval context.

Methods accept `**kwargs` so backend-specific options (e.g. LanceDB's
`where` predicate for metadata filtering, refinement factors,
hybrid-search flags) flow through without changing the ABC.

See `nemo_retriever/vdb/README.md` for the concrete `LanceDB` backend and
the `IngestVdbOperator` / `RetrieveVdbOperator` wrappers, including the
metadata-filtering section and its reference notebook.

        record dicts as produced by the NRL pipeline. Implementations
        transform each record into the table's row format (typically
        columns `vector`, `text`, `metadata`, `source`) and use the

        Sidecar metadata (when supplied via `meta_dataframe` /

        Despite the parameter name `queries` (kept for backward
        compatibility), this method receives a list of embedding vectors,
        one per query. Query text is embedded upstream, typically inside
        `nemo_retriever.Retriever`, before this method is called. Backends
        that need the raw query string for retrieval-time lexical matching
        may additionally consume `query_texts` from `kwargs`; those strings
        must be aligned one-to-one with the input vectors.

        Implementations search the index, apply any post-filtering, and
        return a list of hit lists aligned with the input (one inner list
        per input vector). Stored vector columns should be stripped from
        hits to keep payloads small.

        Common kwargs:
        - top_k (int): neighbors per query.
        - where / _filter (str): a SQL predicate evaluated against table
          columns. NRL stores `content_metadata` (including sidecar
          fields) as a **compact JSON string** in the `metadata` column,
          so JSON filters typically use `LIKE` against a substring of the
          serialized JSON, e.g.
          `metadata LIKE '%"meta_a":"alpha"%'`.
          The `_filter` alias is accepted in addition to `where`.
        - query_texts: raw query strings aligned with the input vectors.
          Dense retrieval backends should not require this. LanceDB hybrid
          search requires it because the backend combines the precomputed
          dense vector with a full-text query at search time.
        - refine_factor / nprobes / search_kwargs: ANN tuning passed
          through to the backend.

        See `nemo_retriever/vdb/README.md` and
        `examples/nemo_retriever_retriever_query_metadata_filter.ipynb`
        for the full filter cookbook (sidecar merge, server-side vs
        client-side filtering, escaping).

        `query_texts` is execution-only context. Operators should avoid
        persisting it in backend constructor kwargs and pass it only for
        retrieval calls whose effective mode needs raw text.

        Note: this method is intentionally **not** decorated with
        :func:`abc.abstractmethod`. Marking it abstract would cause
        Python's ABC machinery to refuse instantiation of any concrete
        :class:`VDB` subclass that does not override ``put`` — which
        would in turn make the early-detection guard in
        :class:`~nemo_retriever.vdb.operators.PutVdbOperator` (which
        compares ``type(self._vdb).put is VDB.put``) permanently
        unreachable, since instantiation would already have failed.
        The default body below raises :class:`NotImplementedError` so
        backends that have not implemented stable-key puts fail fast
        and visibly at the first ``put`` call (and are caught by the
        operator-level guard at construction time).

        ``put`` exists as a separate entry point from
        :meth:`write_to_index` because it has fundamentally different
        semantics. Where ``write_to_index`` is an *append* (or full
        ingest) operation, ``put`` is a **strict in-place replace**:

        * Rows whose key value already exists in the target table are
          **updated in place** — all stored columns (including the dense
          vector) are replaced with the values from ``records``.
        * Rows whose key value does not exist in the target table
          MUST raise :class:`KeyError`. ``put`` MUST NOT insert new
          rows; ingestion of new rows belongs in
          :meth:`write_to_index` / :meth:`run`.
        * Rows whose key value is empty or ``None`` MUST raise
          :class:`KeyError` — a put has no stable identity to target
          without a key.
        * Rows that already exist in the target but are *not* referenced
          by ``records`` are **left untouched**. ``put`` MUST NOT
          delete rows.

        This contract makes ``put`` suitable for in-place metadata
        patches where the caller knows the exact set of existing rows
        it wants to change and would rather fail loudly than silently
        no-op or duplicate data.

        Implementations are expected to:

        * Validate / transform records the same way :meth:`write_to_index`
          does (e.g. enforce the embedding dimension, apply the
          ``on_bad_vectors`` policy), so that a put row is
          indistinguishable from one written via the full-ingest path.
        * Raise :class:`FileNotFoundError` (or an equivalent) when the
          target table does not yet exist. ``put`` MUST NOT create
          tables on the fly.
        * Avoid building heavy secondary structures (e.g. IVF/HNSW
          vector indexes, FTS indexes) on the put path: incremental
          batches are typically too small to train such indexes
          meaningfully. Defer index builds to the next full
          :meth:`write_to_index` / :meth:`create_index` call.

        Parameters:
        - records (list): NV-Ingest-shaped batches (typically a list of
            lists of record dicts) to put into the target. The shape
            mirrors what :meth:`write_to_index` accepts.
        - table_name (str, optional): override the operator's configured
            target table/index name for this call. When ``None``, the
            implementation should use its default target.
        - key (str, optional): name of the column used as the stable
            put key. Defaults to ``"id"``. Rows missing this column
            (or with an empty value) MUST raise :class:`KeyError`.

        Returns:
        - implementation-specific result describing what happened
            (typical fields include the number of rows put).
            Concrete implementations should document the exact return
            shape.

        Backends that genuinely cannot support stable-key puts should
        override this method and raise :class:`NotImplementedError`
        explicitly so that :class:`PutVdbOperator` (and any other
        caller) fails fast with a clear message instead of silently
        no-oping or duplicating rows.
